## Request cache server

is a project that i did when i was bored. Not perfectly built and fully finished yet but it's working (images are not working idk why, a fix is coming soon:tm:)

### How do i install?????
`git clone https://github.com/Takiyo0/request-cache-server`, `npm i`, `npm start`, and `https://localhost:3000`
